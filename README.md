# PA Server
### What is this repo for?
Per our change to a rolling release schedule, sections of our backend API and website will be publically released under the MIT license (see LICENSE for more information).

### Why isn't the code fully published here?
While our launcher (see: *Proj-Ascension/Client*) is being developed as a complete open-source project, our backend has a few more responsibilities in terms of trust - namely, that of information users trust us to provide.

Because of this, our backend/server code will be published here after a battery of internal tests and/or testing with volunteers, to ensure security as best as we can.

### What languages can I expect to see here?
You'll be seeing:
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript (we avoid jQuery where we can)
- Node.js
- PHP 5.6+
- Python

### What if I have more questions?
Hop on over to our subreddit, gitter, or other social media presences, and we'll get back to you promptly.
